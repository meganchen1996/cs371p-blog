**What did I do this past week?** This past week, we learned about move semantics. I have to say, that move semantics has been really tough for me. I'm not sure if it's because I'm just catching up in general from Grace Hopper, or if it's really just a tougher subject, but I really want to be able to get it down before we move onto Inheritance, so I've been going over piazza and my notes lately to make sure I have it down. On Friday, we also learned the difference between local, class, global static and non-static members. I also finished up my Darwin project. I really enjoyed Darwin. Sometimes, we ran into frustrating occurences where we were debugging pointers pointing at garbage values and realized 3 hours later that it was because we were out of scope, but I think it was a great exercise in what we had been learning in class. 

**What's in my way?** Nothing's really in my way right now. I'm starting a lot of final round interviews after having a lull in between, so I suppose that's starting to stress me out. In terms of OOP, I think the only thing really in my way is learning move semantics before we get to inheritance and I forget all about it. 

**What will you do next week?** I will be prepping to start the last project (the semester really flew by so fast), studying networks (oh god) and continuing with my normal life, I guess. As I mentioned in my last blog post, I will be at MLH Prime this weekend. I'm excited for that, because it will probably be the only hackathon I attend this semester that I actually hack at. I'm still wracking my brain for ideas, but I'm sure it's going to be a blast.


**Tip of the week -**
I really don't have a technical tip of the week, which leads me to talk about something else, which is that if you're a computer science major, you don't have to only be interested in pure CS things. Lots of people chose to major in CS because they know it's applicable to a lot of different problems in different industries and spaces. I love engineering, but do I want to be a code monkey at a big company for the next 50 years? Not in the slightest. There are a lot of opportunities out there, so if you're looking for something a little different than what gets most frequently pushed through this department, know that these opportunities exist!
