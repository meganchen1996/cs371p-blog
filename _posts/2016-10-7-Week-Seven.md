title: Week Seven
---

**What did I do this past week?** I studied for and took the OOP test. I also had an Algorithms test, which quite honestly freaked me out a lot more than OOP did. Unfortunately, I kind of ended up devoting a lot of my time to Algo and not getting as much time with OOP as I wanted, but I think it still turned out okay. Ironically, the Algo test was a lot easier than I thought it would be, and OOP was a little harder than I thought it would be. A big mistake of mine was not paying more attention to the specific function signatures in class examples. I think the majority of my deducted points on the test will come from those questions. Honestly, all in all the test was pretty fun for me. It was nice to just code for a test. However, I will say, always hitting the space button in order to create indentation got really old really fast. 

**What's in my way?** Nothing is in my way right now! Life is pretty great! I'm moving forward in interviews and starting to get a better idea of where I'm looking at spending my summer. It's really exciting.

**What will you do next week?** Next week, I'll be hoping my test grades don't destroy me. I'll resume classes and continue interviews (I'm getting sick of saying that). The week after that, I'll be at Grace Hopper! I'm excited, because I'll be flying out soon for a Facebook onsite. While I'm not a huge fan of Facebook as a product, as an engineering company they're outstanding. I would love to do backend work and think that Facebook would be an amazing place to learn. 


**Tip of the week -**
Tip of the week is when studying for OOP tests honestly just READ THE GITHUB EXAMPLES. They were so so helpful to me. I went back in my notes and just retraced how we wrote all the different algorithms and that was invaluable. It was basically the entire test.
