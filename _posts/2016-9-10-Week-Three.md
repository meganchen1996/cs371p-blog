title: Week Three
---

**What did I do this past week?** I finished up Project 1, the Collatz project. Originally, with a naive solution UVA said it took about .2 to run through all the tests. I then implemented a lazy cache that had a size of 2000001 elements, and this made it significantly faster, running at .010. This project was definitely a great refresher in how to properly set up a project, unit testing, scripts, and github. It was confusing at first but I got the hang of it.

In class, we did a refresher in pointers and references, which I enjoyed because I think this is the first time I truly understood absolutely everything that was going on, so that was a success!

**What's in my way?** Nothing's really in my way right now. I wasn't as prepared or as proactive about Project 1 as I wanted to be. The next project is September 22nd, less than 2 weeks from now, so until then I'm just going to catch up on the class readings and keep up with class. Outside of this class, I've just been so busy. I have two interviews coming up next week and feel like I haven't studied adequately at all so I will be finishing my homework like crazy so I can concentrate on studying and prepping for interviews. Career Fair is also looming around the corner and that's nervewracking. 

**What will you do next week?** I'm going to be catching up with the OOP class readings and prepping for interviews.  


**Tip of the week -**
In spirit of prepping for interviews, I thought I'd give a couple tips on good places to go to brush up on data structures. 

The [Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) is a personal favorite of mine. Crack the Coding Interview is a must staple for most, but personally I'm not a huge fan of it. I enjoy looking on Glassdoor at the specific companies I'm interviewing for and getting a feel for the type of questions they ask. I also go to [Career Cup](https://www.careercup.com/page) frequently and it's been invaluable. And for actually doing real hands on practice, I go to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). 

Also as a reminder, DEVELOPER INTERNSHIPS ARE NOT THE ONLY INTERNSHIPS AVAILABLE! There are data science / data analyst roles, product design roles, product management roles, dev evangelism roles, fin tech, consulting and much more!! Don't feel boxed in, because you aren't.
