**What did I do this past week?** I had an interview. I looked over Project 2 and found a partner. I have to say I really love how Professor Downing lectures by thoroughly going through examples and questioning people randomly. By far, some of the most effective lectures I've had in my college career. I already feel like I've learned so much.

**What's in my way?** I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of pair programming, and this is a skill that I should probably improve. I think that having a partner or at least someone to bounce ideas off of and talk your code through with is highly valuable. There have been times where I would just be talking to my mentor about my problems with my code over the summer and the answer to my bug would hit me out of nowhere. That being said, pair programming still takes concentrated effort and a love for communication, so definitely being good at that is a must.  

**What will you do next week?** I'm going to be working on Project 2 with my partner. And interviewing. And going to career fair (bleh).


**Tip of the week -**
I don't really have anything super technical for my tip. I think one thing I will reiterate is that Piazza is and should be your absolute best friend. I feel like too many people ignore it as a resource until the last minute when they're scrambling for answers, but the other day I sat down and just read every unread post one by one and gleaned so much knowledge by the end of it. So, that was cool.

Also, I get most of my tech news by following tech Twitters. I'm biased probably because I interned at Twitter over the summer, but truly the product is great, because I don't need to follow Wired and Recode and TechCrunch individually, and can very often interact directly with writers of the article or people who are relevant to the news I'm consuming. Much better than Facebook as a news source, which is a sinkhole of click bait and dog photos.
