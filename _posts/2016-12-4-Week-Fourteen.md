title: Week Fourteen - My experience in CS 371p
---

Can't believe the semester is over! Overall, I really enjoyed my experience in OOP. For someone who isn't that huge on lower-level languages, I came out with a much bigger appreciation for C++ and software design. 

I read a couple blogs to see how to structure my last post, so I'm going to follow Brian's structure and talk about the different aspects of the class. 

**Lectures**

To start on an extremely positive note, the lectures were by far my favorite thing about this class. Professor Downing has become one of my favorite lecturers that I've had in the CS department, probably even in the entire university. Prof. Downing is engaging and thorough and you learn so much. The daily quizzes, while annoying to some, ended up being a godsend for me. They reaffirmed my knowledge from the last lectures and also kept me accountable to showing up and staying engaged. Professor Downing also cold-calls students in the class and walks them through small parts of code to make sure that everyone is paying attention as well as to impart some individual teaching, and in my opinion this was an awesome system. Seriously, I can't express enough how much I enjoyed lectures. 

I do have a couple small nitpicks. For one, I had discussed with the professor before that the cold-calling did not seem very even. There were a few people I noticed that were called on over and over again, and there was a lot of speculation in the class that those who were called on were people who were not doing well in the class, which I think is a pretty harmful notion. This turned out to be false, but I do wish that people were called on the same amount. I was called on maybe twice or three times the entire semester, I honestly wish I had been called on more, while others seemed to get called on every class. Maybe this is partly due to perception, but definitely wish there was a more even approach to it. 

Secondly, once you left lecture, it was a little hard to follow along with what had happened previously out of sheer memory. When I would look back on my notes or the piazza notes when studying for tests, a lot of the smaller details definitely escaped me and I couldn't remember why we had implemented something a certain way. I definitely took extensive notes in OOP, but there's a lot of material covered over a long period of time, and a lot of it is VERY detailed. I hope that maybe in the future, the code can be commented out a little more in order to make it easier to understand when looking back why something was implemented a certain way. Having a general description of Vector 1, 2, 3, and 4 would have made it easier to understand the differences between the 4 implementations. Just a thought.  


**Projects**

The projects were super hands on. Once again, I learned a lot. Also once again, it taught me more about team-collaboration and accountability. I swear, my time management has increased so much this semester in all aspects of my life solely due to how structed OOP is as a class. My favorite project was Darwin. It was interesting, challenging and relevant to the course. I do wish that the first few had had more to do with what we had been learning in class currently. I understand that Collatz was supposed to help us just get familiar with the assignment, but Netflix was basically a glorified cache and Allocator was honestly just annoying. To me, it didn't really teach you much about allocation or the broader goals of writing your own allocator, it just became a bunch of pointer math. I also wish that there was not a 3 tests per function/method/constructor rule. When trying to modularize code, it kind of ended up decentivizing teams from writing well-formatted code due to wanting to avoid writing like a hundred tests. I also wish that the project specs were a little more clear, but this was mostly a problem for me in the beginning of the year and not by the end of the semester. Projects were a really crucial part of the class and for the most part I enjoyed them. 


**Exams**

Exams are straightforward for sure. I got butchered on the first test. I thought they were going to be more like the quizzes, and talk about specific and detailed concepts. So when it all became about writing code that was specific to syntax, headers, etc., I was a little peeved. In my view, all anyone had to do was memorize the github or put their method headers on their cheat sheet and just call it a day. However, the tests are basically asking if you can reimplement what we learned in class, so is probably a pretty fair way to test your knowledge. I do wish there was more testing you on specifics that we learned in class, like the quizzes. 

One thing I *hated* about exams. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE CHILDREN WRITE THEIR CODE IN CANVAS! It was the most annoying thing about the exams, and quite honestly doubled the time it took to write my exam. The second test was pretty long, and using Canvas actually gave me a headache and I ended up not even finishing the test. I actually think I spent more mental energy on trying not to tab and hitting space repeatedly than actually thinking about the code I was writing. I think it definitely had a not-insigificant effect on my performance on the test. Would love if we could either use a different online text-editor and then copy and paste it in or use our own text-editors. There is literally no reason why we shouldn't be. The only thing that keeps us from cheating as we work on our own laptops is academic integrity. Having our test editor open or a different online text editor instead of Canvas won't change those facts or the chances of someone cheating. 

**Time Commitment**

This class is work intensive. If you put in the work, you will get the grade and is not unfair. But be prepared to be pretty fully engaged all the time in the class. Definitely not a blow-off class. 

**General Thoughts**

Overall, I would reccommend this class for anyone looking for an interesting and engaging class to take. One thing that I liked was that it *was* relevant to many of our career aspirations, as many of us do want to go into industry and this is something that can be directly applicable. It's not really a class you can take and then cram for every time an exam rolls around, but definitely worth taking. If you hate C++ though, maybe don't.
