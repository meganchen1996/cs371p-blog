**What did I do this past week?** This past week in OOP, we talked about the heap vs. the stack and inheritance via the stack vs. the heap. This is directly related to our 5th and final project, Life. In Life, we have an AbstractCell class that both Conway and Fredkin inherit from. We also have a Cell class that is a container for AbstractCells in order to have different types of cells (either Conway or Fredkin) in the same list. I've been working on this project pretty extensively this past week with my partner, and we're on the verge of finishing most implementation (as long as there aren't too many frustrating bugs......)

**What's in my way?** The election outcome really threw off all my concentration this week. I have to play some serious catch up because I haven't really been able to think about anything but politics all week. I didn't end up going to MLH Prime for partly this reason, as I knew there would be no way I could hack while I had so little concentration and so much work piling around me.

**What will you do next week?** I will be finishing my project. I'm flying out Thursday for an interview, so need to do some last minute interview prep, as it's for a position in New York and I'm really hoping to receive this offer. Fingers crossed!


**Tip of the week -**

I'm a very big fan of music data. Here are some of my favorite websites that provide good visualizations or have a lot of complex music-related data. Every Noise is a website that lists all sorts of genres and subsets of genres and gives you examples of those musical genres. You can think click for further information and it lists artists that exhibit those genres. MusicMap is a great visualization of how musical genres relate to eachother and how they have spawned off of each other and gain influences from the past. musimap is a really cool music api company that I met at SXSW 2016. Their api has incredibly specific data. At SXSW, they demonstrated a product where you could input a track and see a breakdown of the kind of genres it was made up of. Like a song might be 60% influenced by disco, 20% house, etc. It could also provide all sorts of data about related artists by percentage and how it analyzed tracks to make these statements.
