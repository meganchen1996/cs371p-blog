title: Week Thirteen

**What did I do this past week?** On Monday, we learned about dynamic binding and dynamic casting. We also wrote Circle's equal method, if equal was a virtual method in Shape, a class that Circle inherits. On Wednesday, we listened to a presentation by Spiceworks employees. Spiceworks is a social network for those in IT careers, and also builds free IT management tools. After telling us about what Spiceworks is built on, they told us a bit about what it's like to work there as well as advice they wished someone had told them when they were young. 

I also finished Project #5. So I'm officially project-free! But I plan on doing the extra-credit project, so I suppose that counts as another project. 

**What's in my way?** 

Nothing's in my way right now. My two main goals in terms of this class for this next week is to get a substantial amount of studying done, as well as finish the extra-credit project. 


**What will you do next week?** 

Next week is Thanksgiving. Then the two weeks after that are my final weeks. I have Algo and OOP on the same day, Dec 1. Then just 3 days after that, I will have my Gov and Networks final on the same day. So despite the fact that I will be shoving my face full of pecan pie, I will also mostly be studying, as I have a lot of material to cover for a lot of classes in the same period of time. 


**Tip of the week -**

I was freaking out last week over an interview I had with a company that I heard asked a lot of dp problems, so I frantically went over a lot of dp problems... Here are some of the links that I found most helpful to help me prepare for DP as well as just gaining a sense of how to solve programming problems in general. I'm not confident when it comes to tech interviews. Frankly, I'm pretty bad at them and this recruiting season my tech interview luck has been all over the place. These problems and sites really helped me review general principles by looking at specific utilisations of them in programming problems.

Also, if you can't learn very well from slides and proofs and mathematical symbols, look your problem up on Youtube. There are some WILDLY helpful videos on Youtube and sometimes I feel like I learn better from Youtube than from lecture.
